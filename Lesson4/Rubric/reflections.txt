Your response goes here!

I have learned about span and the use of paragraphs during the project. It was very helpful to remember the syntax of image and for a hyper link

Th easiest part is the way the code has been already present and I had to copy paste the text. I would appreciate the effort the team has put on our behalf. This made the task easy as to only think on the necessary stuffs.

Nothing has been difficult

I remembered the lectures and its concepts so when necessary I used google the class notes to rethink of the HTML elements which needs to be used.
